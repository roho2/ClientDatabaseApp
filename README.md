2. Command Area:
        In the top right is a large text area to input SQL commands you want executed
3. Result Area:
        The bottom portion of the screen. Includes a status indicator to if you are connected, 
        a button to connect to the database, a button to clear the SQL Command Area, and a button
        to execute the SQL Command in the Command Window. This section also includes an output text 
        area that displays the results of the SQL query and a button on the bottom to clear that area.
